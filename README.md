# Coputer-Vision
I am currently working with computer vision with an ultimate goal of building a sign language trainslator

NB: I am using better comment extension, this might make some of my comments seem wired to you

## Progress so far:
The learing process is really interesting, these are what I have accomplish:

- A blue Screen minipulator script screen that removes the blue screen from an image and replaces it with another background
- A green screen minipulator script similar to that of the blue screen
- A colour selection script (currently for pink)
- A day and Night image classifier that uses the H and V channel to classify the image, currently at 97.5% accuracy
- Created an edge detection script that implemented fourier transform
- Created a high pass filter for detecting edges. The filter takes in a Karnel and a gray image and then returns a binary edged image
